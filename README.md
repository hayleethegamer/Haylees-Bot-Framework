# Haylees-Bot-Framework
This is the framework I created for my own Discord bots. It should be as simple as get it and put it and the discord library of your choice (It's the Translator is coded for discord.py (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) in the root of your bot. the Library should be named "discord" unless you want to go and change the Translator's import. If you are using a different library you may have to change the translator anyway, however, that should be the only file that requires modification.
